# Age-Prediction-using-Images.

Age prediction as a CV task is useful for various real-world applications, such as age-restricted content filtering, personalised marketing targeting specific age demographics, enhancing security systems with age verification, and assisting in medical diagnostics and age-related research. The problem statement is to build a model to predict the age of a person, given the image of their face. (Only ImageNet Dataset pre-trained checkpoints can be used for transfer learning.)
